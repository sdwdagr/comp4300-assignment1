标题与说明
 
-  Assignment Notes: 
 
提交说明
 
-  Note: You will be required to submit main.cpp and NO OTHER FILES for this assignment. Submission will take place on D2L's Assignment 1 Dropbox. Only ONE student from each group of two should submit the assignment. 
 
参考文件说明
 
-  Working solutions are included with the assignment so that you can see what a correct solution looks like. These executables are located in the 'bin' directory, and are provided for 64 bit Windows (10 / 11). 
 
重要提示
 
-  VERY IMPORTANT: 
​
-  - Only submit main.cpp and no other files via D2L 
​
-  - Do not submit main.cpp inside a zip file 
​
-  - Do not submit main.cpp inside a Word.doc 
​
-  - Do not submit main.cpp with a project file for an IDE 
​
-  - Only submit main.cpp and no other files

YOU MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING INFO IN A COMMENT AT THE TOP OF main.cpp:
 
- BOTH students' full names, cs usernames, and student numbers
- If you did not get a specific feature to work (such as text centering), please explain what you tried to do to get it to work, and partial mark may be given for effort.

In this assignment you will be writing a C++/SFML program which will read descriptions of shapes from a configuration file, and then drawing those shapes to the screen. Each shape will have a name, position, speed, color, as well as properties unique to each shape type. For example, a Rectangle will have width and height, and a circle will have a Radius. For this assignment, the position of a shape refers to its SFML default of the upper-left corner of the shape.
 
You are also required to make these shapes "bounce" off the sides of the window which contains them. This means that if the shape's left side hits the left side of the window, its X speed reverses. If the top of the shape hits the top of the window, its Y speed reverses. Similarly, if it hits the right side or bottom of the window. You can assume that all shapes will always be configured to start entirely within the window, and you don't have to worry about what happens if

entirely within the window, and you don't have to worry about what
they start outside the window. Each shape's name should be drawn on the exact
center of the shape in the given font size and color specified in the file.
(note: this may be the trickiest part of the assignment, you will not lose many
marks if it's not the exact center)
 
You are also required to implement an ImGui user interface which is able to:
 
- List all of the shapes and select any one of them to edit their properties
- Toggle whether or not the selected shape will be drawn
- Change the scale of the shape (0 to 4)
- Change the x and y velocity of the shape (-8 to 8)
- Change the color of the shape
- Change the name of the shape
 
UI Note: Do not worry if rapidly changing the scale parameter causes the
shape to go outside the bounds of the rectangle. Assume that it will
only be changed to remain within the rectangle. The newly scaled
shape should properly bounce with its new size.
 
A sample configuration file is given to you in config.txt, however marking will
be done with an unseen configuration file in order to test more completely. Be
sure to add and remove your own shapes to this file to test if they all work
correctly.
 
Each line of the configuration file specifies one of the config settings of the
assignment program, with the first string in each line being the type of setting
that the rest of the line specified. Lines in the config file can be one of the
following types, and lines can appear in any order in the file.
 
Window W H
 
- This line declares that the SFML Window must be constructed
with width W and height H, each of which will be integers

Font F S R G B
 
- This lines defines the font which is to be used to draw text
for this program. The format of the line is as follows:
- Font File          F              std::string 
                                  (it will have no spaces)
- Font Size         S             int
- RGB Color       (R,G,B)     int, int, int
 
Rectangle N X Y SX SY R G B W H
 
- Defines a RectangleShape with:
- Shape Name Name std::string
- Initial Position   (X,Y)          float, float
- Initial Speed      (SX,SY)      float, float
- RGB Color         (R,G,B)        int, int, int
- Size                   (W,H)         float, float
 
Circle N X Y SX SY R G B R
 
- Defines a CircleShape with:
- Shape      Name           N            std::string
- Initial       Position      (X,Y)         float, float
- Initial       Speed         (SX,SY)     float, float
- RGB         Color           (R,G,B)      int, int, int
- Radius                         R              float
 
 
 
Assignment Hints
 
- In order to store an arbitrary number of shapes from the configuration file,
you must store them in a container - std::vector is recommended.
- Consider creating a custom class or struct which stores all of the properties
of a shape that are not stored within the sf::Shape class itself
example: velocity, name, etc
- A shape will 'touch' the side of the window if its bounding box makes
contact with it. Each shape's bounding rectangle can be obtained via:
shape.getLocalBounds(); // .top, .left, .width, .height
- gives the LOCAL position of the (top, left) of the rectangle
- LOCAL pos means it is relative to shape.getPosition(), not the window
- as well as the (width, height) size of the rectangle
 
shape.getGlobalBounds() will take into account any scale, translation, etc
that has been applied to the shape. May be useful for the ui scaling
 
- Similarly, a sf::Text element's bounding rectangle can also be
retrieved via text.getLocalBounds(), which you will need to use to
center the text properly within a shape.

- Please use C++ file reading (std::ifstream makes this easy) rather
than C-style FILE reading. You will lose marks for using older C functions!
